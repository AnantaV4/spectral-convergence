Overview

This repository implements a computational engine for spectral-operator convergence in extremely high dimensions (up to 144,000D). The codebase provides a research prototype for exploring:

high-resolution spectral lattices

convergence rates under nonlinear deformations

stability across harmonic, vibronic, or perturbative excitations

behaviors relevant to analytical conjectures in complex analysis and spectral theory


This work draws conceptual inspiration from CMMF v3.0, a multimodal framework designed to unify quantum spectral dynamics, machine learning operators, and systemic convergence principles.

While the CMMF program applies these ideas to origins-of-life research, this repository isolates the mathematical spectral core and develops it as a stand-alone research tool for:

spectral analysis

operator convergence diagnostics

large-N harmonic systems

prototype AI-augmented spectral mappings



---

Motivation

Spectral convergence problems appear across mathematics, physics, chemistry, and machine learning. This repository focuses on the numerical exploration of:

spectral operators defined on high-dimensional lattices

resonant modes and eigenvalue clustering

stability regions and chaotic transitions

convergence vs divergence under large-N deformation

quantum-spectral landscapes relevant to vibronic coupling analyses


The 144,000-dimensional operator provided here represents a boundary case for extremely dense spectral topologies, useful for stress-testing conjectures and probing the behavior of spectral–zeta structures under heavy perturbation.

Conceptual Background

This code draws from several foundational ideas elaborated in The Convergent Multi-Modal Framework (CMMF) v3.0:

1. Spectral Layer

The spectral layer is defined by a vibronic-inspired operator acting on very high-dimensional lattices. These operators probe:

local vs global stability

perturbative drift

convergence rate gradients

resonance-induced distortions


2. Quantum-Spectral Bridge (QSB)

While the full QSB formalism integrates coherence and vibronic coupling, this repository focuses solely on the spectral side—isolating the operator convergence dynamics.

3. Convergence Operators

The long-term direction of this repository is to incorporate:

neural spectral operators

equivariant GNNs

spectral attention layers

cross-modal convergence mappings


These will form the backbone of future AI-augmented spectral prediction.

Applications

High-dimensional convergence exploration

Spectral analysis of nonlinear operators

Algorithmic experimentation for mathematical conjectures
